Interpolating Polynomial Methods in python
#Description This program runs different approximation methods that use the interpolating concept

-Solves the Neville Method using given x and f(x) values

-Solves the Newton Forward Method with given x and f(x) values

-Solves a Newton Forward Approximation for a given f(x) value

-Solves a Hermite Polynomial Approximation with a given set of data

-Solves a cublic Spline interpolation with a given set of data

#Dependencies -The program uses the numpy library to generate matrixes and solve vector muliplication

-The only dependency is numpy

pip install -r requirements.txt

#How to Run the program -The bash script to run the program is python main.py

-All values have already been input into the program for the desired calucations, so no input is needed.

#Contributors -This program was written by Andrew Chambers

-The program does use a code derived from the code in the posted slides of Dr Khanh Vu

#License -The program is licensed under the MIT License
